# basic-express-server

* during this lab i made a server to be deployed to heroku 

i made a home route 

and i made 2 middleware files

1- thats called 'logger' to console.log the route and method


2- thats called 'validator' to check on path that is called person that takes a query and either console.logs as a string it or gives a 500 error message


i made test files to check all routes work properly
